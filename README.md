# TriviaGame

I did the onbutton click event for this assignment.

I was able to loop and create div's with the possible answers to a question that I wanted.  From there I assigned attributes so I could call the class later and us (this) in order to depict what was being clicked.

If you get the question right an image will replace the question and answers to let you know you won.

If you are wrong you will get an alert letting you know you are wrong, you can click away and continue.

While this is happening there is a timer that is counting down to let you know how much time you have left.  If you get get to the end, a "you lose" will flash on the page and you can try again by reloading the page.

Functionality missing:
- multiple questions: It took me a while to get this one so I did radio buttons on another Javascript file which I will attach for you to view.  I put the questions in an array with objects for each question and answer and correct answer, much cleaner.
- start button to begin the game.

Although missing functionality, I still believe I hit some milestones with this assignment.

Thanks!
